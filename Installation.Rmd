## Install Overview

Installing R is a pretty straightforward process.  I like to use RStudio for the development environment.  The installation is a two step process.

- Install R
- Install RStudio

The links for both of these packages are provided in the subsequent pages.

## Tips and Tricks

I didn't have any issues with the installation.  I just went with the default choices and it went off without a hitch.  I've got a 64 bit Windows 7 computer, I haven't tried the installation on any other OS.  

The following screen shows the RStudio development environment.
